The class receives from the user if they want a monitor mode service and if it is expected that the user will
also provide the number of seconds in which they want the mode to sample all services running.
Or if they want a manual mode service and if so we expect the user to provide a 
first date and first hour and a second date and second hour.
on condition we get all the information we want, we pass the information to the relevant function in the relevant
department otherwise we will print an error and close the program.
